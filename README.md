  
# CPU-Scheduling-Simulator
**CPU-Scheduling-Simulator** is a React web app (HTML, CSS/TailwindCSS, JavaScript) designed for CSE undergraduates studying Operating Systems. It helps visualize CPU scheduling by generating Gantt charts, detailed result tables (showing process arrival, burst, start, end, waiting, and turnaround times), and calculating average waiting and turnaround times to aid learning in OS theory and lab courses.

  



## Target Audience
**CPU-Scheduling-Simulator** application is specifically designed for CSE undergraduate students who are studying Operating Systems theory and lab courses, helping them better understand CPU scheduling concepts through interactive visualization and practical simulation tools.
